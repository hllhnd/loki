# The Loki Build System
A modern build system for the productive C developer.

## Help Wanted
Loki is an ambitious project and as such I can't do everything alone. Helping with [issues tagged as 'help wanted'](https://github.com/hllhnd/loki/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) would be greatly appreciated.

## Current State
Loki is currently extremely early in development. The design is going to constantly change in breaking ways with reckless abandon. As such, Loki should only be used for testing, unless you're willing to keep up with the constant changes.

## Example Project
The [`example` folder](example) contains a "Hello, world!" application. This will be kept up to date during development of Loki. If this example fails to compile, please raise an issue.

## License
