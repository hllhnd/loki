# The Loki Build System
A modern build system for the productive C developer.

## Current State
Loki is currently extremely early in development. The design is going to constantly change in breaking ways with reckless abandon. As such, Loki should only be used for testing, unless you're willing to keep up with the constant changes.

## Example Project
The [`example` folder](example) contains a "Hello, world!" application. This will be kept up to date during development of Loki. If this example fails to compile, please raise an issue.

## License
Loki is made available under the GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version.

See [the LICENSE file](LICENSE) or [the GNU GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) for more information.
